Today is the second practical about using `dplyr`.

To access the problems, there will be another R Markdown document for you to work through. Once again you'll be filling the answers into the chunks. All the problems have **example output**. Take a look at the example output to help you work through the problem. Try things out, see what happens, and eventually you'll get it right!

Good luck!
