Today's practical is all about how to manipulate data using `dplyr`

We're going to be working through **a lot** of problems. If you struggle with
them, then don't worry. You can also come back to these problems are your
confidence builds. With some practise you'll start to find the problems easier. 

To access the problems, I've made an RMarkdown document for you to work
through. You'll just been filling in the code chunks to complete the problems.
All the problems have **example output**. Take a look at the example output to
help you work through the problem. Try things out, see what happens, and
eventually you'll get it right!

Good luck!
