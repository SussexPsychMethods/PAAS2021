# Getting set up

- Using **R Studio** on campus is a little different to how you'd use it on
  your personal computer 

- There's a special way of starting it, and there's a special place where you
  need to store your files

- For the smoothest most hassle-free experience you need to make sure you follow
the instructions **carefully**

<br />

*So things might be a bit slow to get going today*]]

Patience will be one of the great *transferable skills* you learn from this
course!

## Saving and accessing your files

When you're using the lab computers you save all your work on **OneDrive**

.pull-right[

- You first need to login to your Sussex **OneDrive** my clicking on the OneDrive
  icon on the task bar and entering your login details 

- You can also download the **OneDrive** app onto your home computer so that you
  can access your work from off campus
]

<br />

Whenever you come into to use the lab computers you should always make sure
you're sure that you're signed into **OneDrive** before doing anything else.

After if you've signed in once then you *should* be automatically signed in but
you should always double check
