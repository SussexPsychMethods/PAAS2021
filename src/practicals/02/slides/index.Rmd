# Plan for today

- Short Q&A

**Getting set up**

- Installing all the software we'll need

**Algorithmic thinking**

- Practical Task on algorithmic thinking

# Getting set up

- Using **R Studio** on campus is a little different to how you'd use it on
  your personal computer 

- There's a special way of starting it, and there's a special place where you
  need to store your files

- For the smoothest most hassle-free experience you need to make sure you follow
the instructions **carefully**

<br />

.center[.blue[*And remember, the computers in these labs haven't been used for over a year!*

*So things might be a bit slow to get going today*]]

???

Patience will be one of the great *transferable skills* you learn from this
course!

## Saving and accessing your files

When you're using the lab computers you save all your work on **OneDrive**

.pull-left[![](https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/sussex_cloud.png)]

.pull-right[

- You first need to login to your Sussex **OneDrive** my clicking on the OneDrive
  icon on the task bar and entering your login details 

- You can also download the **OneDrive** app onto your home computer so that you
  can access your work from off campus
]

<br />

Whenever you come into to use the lab computers you should always make sure
you're sure that you're signed into **OneDrive** before doing anything else.

After if you've signed in once then you *should* be automatically signed in but
you should always double check

## Starting R Studio on Campus

Double click the **software hub** icon to get started

**Starting R Studio on Campus**

.center[<img width="75%" src="https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/launch_rstudio.png"></img>]

Find the RStudio icon <img
src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/papirus-team/papirus-apps/512/rstudio-icon.png"
height = "40px" style="vertical-align:middle;"> and click **Launch**

If the launch icon is greyed out and says .blue[Authorisation needed] then just
wait a sec or click the refresh icon <img
src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Ic_refresh_48px.svg"
height = "40px" style="vertical-align:middle;"> 

???

Give the students a chance to start RStudio on their computers

## Installing the packages we need

The last step to get everything set up for the course is to *install the
"packages"* we need... 


We'll learn more about what packages are in the coming weeks, but for now you
can just following the instructions:


---

exclude: ![:online]

## Installing the packages we need

<small> Copy and paste the text below into **RStudio** in the "console" window:
<pre><code>
source("https://files.mindsci.net/install.r")
</pre></code>
</small>

# Practical task

Computers are **dumb** but people are **smart**

- This means that we need to be **super explicit** when we give instructions to
computers 

- Things that might seem easy **need** to be broken down into **simple steps**

We don't usually do this when we give instructions to **other people** because
**people** have common sense, they can understand context, they can *infer*
things when information/instructions are missing

**In todays's practical task** we're going to see how this works, so we can

1. Understand the nature of the problem itself

2. Get practice solving it!

---

## Practical task instructions

For the practical task we're going to split into **groups of 5** 

1. One person from the group is going to .green[*play the role of the computer*]

2. And the other group members will .blue[*play the role the programmers*]

The task will be for the .blue[*programmers*] to give instructions to the
.green[*computer*] on how to draw a simple picture

<br />

.center[I'll get the .green[*computers*] to close their eyes now so that they
don't see the task]

exclude: ![:hidden]

## The task

The task will be to draw a simple house... something along the lines of this:

## The task 2.0

This time, the task will be to draw this stickman:

**Keep in mind how clear & specific you need to be from the last task!**

# Tasks for next week

- Take the practice quiz on [Canvas](). This is based on the content of
  tutorial 1

- Complete the second PAAS tutorial on
  [Canvas](https://paas.netlify.app/tutorials/02/). This will form the basis of
  Quiz 2, which you'll do next week
