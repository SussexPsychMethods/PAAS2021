In today's practical we're going to learn how to organize data in the **tidy** way.

# Messy and Tidy data


<img style="display:flex;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;" src="./assets/tidydata_1.jpg" />

The best way to understand the structure of **tidy data** is for us to collect
some data, and then enter it in a **tidy way**.

Our tasks for today will involve:

1. Creating some data (to do this, we'll run a quick experiment)

2. Enter that data into a spreadsheet (we'll use google docs) 

3. Download the spreadsheet as a `.csv` file

4. FInally, **read** that data into `R Studio`

## Creating some data

To create some data, we're just going to run a quick colour Stroop task. In the
colour Stroop task you have to identify the **colour** of word. The words can
be printed in <span style="color:red">Red</span>, <span
style="color:blue">Blue</span>, <span style="color:yellow">Yellow</span>, or
<span style="color:green">Green</span>.

The words that are used in the task are colour names (e.g., Red, Blue, Green,
and Yellow).

The words are presented under two conditions:

1. In the congruent condition the colour of the word matches the name (e.g.,
   <span style="color:red">Red</span>, <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>)

2. In the incongruent condition the colour of the word does not match the name
   (e.g., <span style="color:red">Blue</span>, <span
   style="color:blue">Red</span>)

At the end of the task you'll be presented with two numbers. One will be how
quickly you could identify the colour for in the congruent condition, and the
other will be how quickly you could identify the colour in the incongruent
condition. 


<iframe src="./assets/paas_stroop.html" width="600" height="600" scrolling="no" style="border:none" />


\

Write down these two numbers. Make sure you note which number is for which
condition!

The next thing we need is a identifier for each of you. Participants identifier
are necessary because we need to know which two numbers belong to which person. 

The participant identifier should be **unique** so two participants don't have
the same one. However, you also shouldn't use something like the participant's
name, because the participant's data should be anonymised. To generate an
anonymous participant ID, enter your name and a random number into the box
below. This will generate your participant ID. You should also write this down. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::includeScript("helpers.js")
```

\

<div class="subid"><input id="subenter" placeholder="your name and a random
number" style="width:18em"></input><button onclick="GenerateID()">Generate
ID</button><span id="subid"></span></div>


\


Next, we'll split the class into two groups *as if* we were doing a between
groups study. Click the box below to get your group ID. You should also write
this down.


\

<div class="groupid"><button onclick="GenerateGroup()">Get Group
ID</button><span id="groupid"></span></div>


\

We all should now have four bits of information. A reaction time for the
congruent condition on the Stroop task, a reaction for the incongruent
condition of the Stroop task, your participant ID, and your group ID. 



## Entering the data in a spreadsheet

Now we'll enter this data into a spreadsheet. We'll enter the data in the
**tidy** way. This means that each of the two measurements will go on their own
row. 

Follow <span id="link"></span>

When you're entering the data, remember that identifiers have to be specified **exactly**

1. The two identifiers for the two conditions are **con** (for the congruent
   condition) and **inc** (for the incongruent condition). Be careful to watch
   the spelling.

2. For your **id** code, make sure you enter it exactly as it's shown on the
   sheet above. \

3. The same applies for the **group** identifier

4. And for the reaction time (**rt**)

Once the class has finished entering the data into the spreadsheet, we'll
download the spreadsheet onto our computers. To download the spreadsheet go to:

File **>** Download **>** Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)

Save the file into the **data** sub folder of your **project folder** and give it the name **stroop.csv**

## Reading the data into `R`

Finally, we'll read the data into `R`. Doing this will involve two steps. 

1. We'll use the `here::here()` function to translate our directions from
   **here** into a file path (just as we did last week with the image file)

2. We'll use the `readr::read_csv()` function to actually read in the file.


`r prob()` 

Again, we'll start off by creating a **R Project**. You can call it whatever
you want, but `prac_08` is probably a good name.

`r prob()` 

Create a new **R Markdown** (`.Rmd`) file and create out everything expect the
header and the **setup** code chunk.

`r prob()`


Make sure you load the **here**, the **readr**, and the **tibble** package in
the **setup** code chunk.

:::{.hint}
The `library()` function is used for loading packages
:::

`r prob()`


Create a new code chuck. In this code chunk do the following things:

1. Use **here** to give the directions to the data file

2. Use the directions generated by **here** as the input to the **read_csv**
   function from the **readr** package. This will read in the data.

3. Make sure you assign the output of the **read_csv** function to an object!

:::{.hint}
This is almost exactly the same as what we did last week, expect
we're using **read_csv** to read a data file instead of **include_graphics** to
read an image file. If you're stuck, check back to [last week's
practical](https://paas.netlify.app/practicals/07/worksheet/).

<pre class="bash copy"><code>---
title: "Untitled"
output: html_document

&#96;&#96;&#96;{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
# load the packages
library("here")
library("readr")
library("tibble")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
 
&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
# read in the data
data_file <- here::here("data/stroop.csv")
stroop_tib <- readr::read_csv(file = data_file)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>


:::

`r prob()`

Now that we've read our data into an object, add a new code chunk which simply
calls that object, so that the content will be printed out below the code
chunk.

`r prob()`

Now let's try **knit** our **R Markdown** document, to make sure everything has
worked correctly.

\




`r prob()`

For the next problem, we're also going to try use the `dplyr::select()` function.

Add the code chunk below into your **RMarkdown** document

<pre class="bash copy"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
penguin_data <- palmerpenguins::penguins
penguin_data
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

Once you've copied this code chunk into this document then make sure you 
run it, because it will load some data.


`r prob()`

Now that you have the data loaded, use `dplyr::select()` to select the `island`,
and `species` column. You end result should look like the following:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
penguin_data %>% dplyr::select(island, species)
```

:::{.tutor}
<pre class="bash copy"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
dplyr::select(.data = penguin_data, island, species)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>
:::

`r prob()`

Now that you have a sense of how the `dplyr::select()` function works, let's try
a problem where you don't have an output to compare it to.

For this problem, we'll be using the **stroop** data tibble that we created
earlier. This **tibble** should have a column for `id`, `condition`, `rt` and
`group`. Since people were just put into two **groups** which didn't really
mean anything, let's **drop** the `group` column from this tibble.

:::{.tutor}
<pre class="bash copy"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
dplyr::select(.data = stroop_data, -group)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>
:::

`r prob()`

We're not going to cover how to make **pretty formatted tables** this year. But
for this task we'll just do something very basic that won't require much
explanation.

To make a tibble into a nicely formatted table, we can use a function called
`kable()` from the `knitr` package. This function takes one input `x`, which 
will just be a **tibble**.

Add a new code chunk where the **tibble** we created earlier is used at the
input to the `knitr::kable()` function. Also, make sure you load the **knitr**
package in the setup code chunk.

Once you've down this, **knit** the document again and see what the nicely
formatted table looks like.


:::{.tutor}
<pre class="bash copy"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::kable(x = stroop_data) 
</code></pre>
