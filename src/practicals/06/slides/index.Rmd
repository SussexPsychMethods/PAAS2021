## Today

- Q&amp;A about last week's tutorial and practical

- Assignment and data structures

  - One-off commands vs writing code in `.Rmd` files

  - Vectors

  - Tibbles

- Attendance

- Work through the worksheet

---

## One-off commands vs code chunks

- We use programming to achieve a task

- Code is a sequence of steps/instructions that we give to the computer to
  perform the task we want done

- We can write these instructions (the code) down into **code chunks** 

- Sometime we might want to run code that isn't part of the main set of
  instructions for the task we're trying to perform. For example, 

  * We might want to quickly check if something worked correctly

  * or do a quick calculation

  * or we might want to visually inspect our data
  
For one-off commands like this, we might choose to run them at the **console**
rather than writing them down in a **code chunk**


---

## Assignment

- **Objects** in `R` are just little containers that hold some data

- **Objects** have names (like little labels on containers)

- We can use the **label** to refer to the content of the container

- To **create** an object we use the **assignment operator** `<-`

For example, the following code means *Put the data (a character string) "some
words" into the box labelled `container`*

```{.r}
container <- "some words"
```


---

## Assignment

**Once assigned, the name can be used in the same way as the object it represents**

For example, we can right some code to put a **vector** of numbers in a
container labelled `my_numbers`

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(11, 4, 147)
```

Later in the code chunk we could write the following code

```{.r}
half_numbers <- my_numbers / 2
```

Which means: *Take (a copy of) the numbers inside the container labelled `my_numbers` and
divide them by 2*. *Put the result in a container labelled `half_numbers`*

---

## Types of Data: Vectors

- Groupings of *elements*: numbers, character strings, logical values

- Can be arbitrarily long (zero or more elements)

- Can only contain **one type of element** (e.g., only character strings,
  logical values, or numbers)

- Created primarily with the `c()` function.


**An example of a vector of numbers**

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
more_numbers <- c(my_numbers, -4321, 3.14)
more_numbers
```


---

## Types of Data: Vectors



**An example of a vector of letters and words**

```{r}
some_letters <- c("A", "e", "X", "K", "r", "dog")
some_letters
```

**Mixing letters and numbers will result in the numbers being converted into
*numerals***

```{r}
numerals_letter <- c(1, "A")
numerals_letter
```

---

## Types of data: Tibbles 

- `R`'s version of spread sheets

```{r}
books <- tibble::tibble(
  title = c("Mrs Dalloway", "Another Country", "Burger's Daugher"),
  author = c("Virginia Woolf", "James Baldwin", "Naine Gordimer"),
  year = c(1925, 1962, 1979),
  pages = c(224, 436, 364)
) 
```

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tibble(
  title = c("Mrs Dalloway", "Another Country", "Burger's Daugher"),
  author = c("Virginia Woolf", "James Baldwin", "Naine Gordimer"),
  year = c(1925, 1962, 1979),
  pages = c(224, 436, 364)
) %>% knitr::kable()
```

We'll never **manually create** tibbles by typing in the data (expect for the
example on the worksheet). Instead we'll **read** in data from files (more on
that in the coming weeks)

---

## Types of data: Tibbles 

Each column is a vector and can be selected using `$`

```{r}
books$author
```


Because each column is a vector, you can do anything with it that you can do
with a vector.


```{r}
half_point <- books$pages / 2
half_point
```

### The quiz

If you haven't completed the **Week 6** quiz then make sure to do it after this
class.

Remember that the Quiz closes on Saturday, and if you miss the deadline then
you won't get a second chance!
