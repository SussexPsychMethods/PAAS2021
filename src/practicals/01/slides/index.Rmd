# Introducing R and R RStudio

.pull-left[![](https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/r_logo.png)]

???

**R** is a free software environment for doing statistical computing and
graphics

--


.pull-right[![](https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/base_r.png)]


???


But the interface for **R** isn't very user friendly for novices! It can be
intimidating to use, ugly, and it is difficult to access a lot of the
information that you might need.

# Introducing R and R RStudio


.pull-left[![](https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/r_logo.png)]

???

Instead of using **R** by itself, we use a second bit of software called **R Studio**.

--

.pull-right[![](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png)]

???

 **R Studio** makes using a **R** a little more user friendly. **R Studio** has
 a lot of extra built in functionality. This includes an editor for writing
 your code, a graphics window for viewing your graphs and figures, and a data
 viewer for viewing any data that you might be working with. You can use **R**
 without **RStudio**, but because **RStudio** interfaces with **R**, to use
 **RStudio** you must first install **R**.

 We'll get around to orientating ourselves in **RStudio** soon but first you're
 probably wondering why you're learning **R** in the first place

# Getting set up

- Using **R Studio** on campus is a little different to how you'd use it on
  your personal computer 

- There's a special way of starting it, and there's a special place where you
  need to store your files

- For the smoothest most hassle-free experience you need to make sure you follow
the instructions **carefully**

<br />

.center[.blue[*And remember, the computers in these labs haven't been used for over a year!*

*So things might be a bit slow to get going today*]]


???

Patience will be one of the great *transferable skills* you learn from this
course!

## Saving and accessing your files

When you're using the lab computers you save all your work on **OneDrive**

.pull-left[![](https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/sussex_cloud.png)]

.pull-right[

- You first need to login to your Sussex **OneDrive** my clicking on the OneDrive
  icon on the task bar and entering your login details 

- You can also download the **OneDrive** app onto your home computer so that you
  can access your work from off campus
]

<br />

Whenever you come into to use the lab computers you should always make sure
you're sure that you're signed into **OneDrive** before doing anything else.

After if you've signed in once then you *should* be automatically signed in but
you should always double check

## Starting R Studio on Campus

Double click the **software hub** icon to get started

**Starting R Studio on Campus**

.center[<img width="75%" src="https://github.com/ljcolling/my_images/raw/master/launch_rstudio.png"></img>]

Find the RStudio icon <img
src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/papirus-team/papirus-apps/512/rstudio-icon.png"
height = "40px" style="vertical-align:middle;"> and click **Launch**

If the launch icon is greyed out and says .blue[Authorisation needed] then just
wait a sec or click the refresh icon <img
src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Ic_refresh_48px.svg"
height = "40px" style="vertical-align:middle;"> 

???

Give the students a chance to start RStudio on their computers

## Installing the packages we need

The last step to get everything set up for the course is to *install the
"packages"* we need... 


We'll learn more about what packages are in the coming weeks, but for now you
can just following the instructions:


---

exclude: ![:online]

## Installing the packages we need

<small> Copy and paste the text below into **RStudio** in the "console" window:
<pre><code>
source("https://files.mindsci.net/install.r")
</pre></code>
</small>

.center[<img src="./Capture.jpg" height="300px">]

<small>You can also find the command on the Week 1 Canvas page</small>

# Practical task: SMARM study

- As part of this module, you will have weekly quizzes that assess your
  understanding of topics covered in the tutorials & practicals

- For this week, instead of a quiz, we have a survey for you to complete, if
  you complete the survey and pass the attention checks, you get an automatic
  100% for your first quiz mark

- The survey covers your attitudes, opinions, and experiences with statistics,
  maths, and coding, with some questions about anxiety and gender identity, &
  we also want to use your responses to link to your attendance, & marks etc. 

- **You can access the Qualtrics link on
  [Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/15795/quizzes/26175)**, when
  you’ve finished the survey, enter the completion codes in the quiz (you can
  still participate in the survey, but not consent to the study with no impact
  on your quiz mark & no impact on the practical today)

- Make sure to read all the consent information - this is a *real* study

# Practical task: study design

The aim of the practical task today is to get us .blue[*thinking*]
.blue[*about*] .blue[*science*] so we're going to do a little brain-storming
session

For the brain-storming session, we’ll be using
[Etherpad](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/15795/pages/week-1) to work
together in groups

**In your groups you’ll be brain-storming:**

- a poorly constrained psychology study: One where it’s difficult to clearly
  define things we’re manipulating and measuring

- an impossible psychology study

- a study that is not useful in the real world

- bias in psychology studies and bias in publishing psychology studies


???


Don’t worry if you don’t understand some of the terminology. We’ll be covering
all this material as we progress in the course. The aim for today is for you to
see how much you already know. and you can draw on your experience today now
that you've taken part in a real study yourselves,

# Tasks for next week

- Complete the first PAAS tutorial on [Canvas](https://paas.netlify.app/tutorials/01/)

  + Install R & RStudio on your own computers

  + Setup OneDrive if you wish
