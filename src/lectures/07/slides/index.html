## Describing things with maths

- Quantitative methodology deals with measurable things (variables)

- It explains and predicts the world around us by modelling relationships between variables

- These models are mathematical/statistical in nature and they are based on numeric descriptions of variables

- Variables differ in their range and distribution and _from population to population_
  - Air temperature on Earth ranges from about &amp;minus;90&amp;deg;C to about 60&amp;deg;C
  - Temperature produced by humans under laboratory conditions: &lt;span class="no-break"&gt;&amp;minus;273&amp;deg;C - 5.5 trillion&amp;deg;C&lt;/span&gt;
  - Distribution of height is _normal_, distribution of wealth is _skewed_

- The term population **does not only refer to people**!

- The most basic ways in which we can describe variables and their distributions is in terms of **central tendency** and **spread**

---

## Central tendency and spread

- Distribution of the values in a variable can be described in terms of

  - its "average" value, *i.e.*, where the _"most typical"_, or **central** value is located along the possible range of values
  
  - how much _variability_ there is in the individual values of the variable in the sample or population , *i.e.*, how much the values are **spread** along the range of values
  
- There are various measures of both central tendency and spread, each with its pros and cons

- All of them are mathematical _abstractions_ - they provide useful information but they're not all there is to things

---

name: central

## Measures of central tendency

- Measures that tell us about the _"most typical"_ value of a variable

- What does "most typical" mean though?

- Different measures of central tendency have different answers

.codePanel[

```r
salary &lt;- read.csv("assets/world_salary.csv")
salary %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = yearly)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000) +
  labs(x="Annual salary in USD", y = "Count")
```

.center[.smol[_Fig 1_ Average national annual salary on a sample of 78 countries]]

---

## Measures of central tendency

- We'll talk about three of these measures

  - the mode

  - the median

  - the arithmetic mean

- They are all different kinds of _average_

---

## Mode

- The most frequent value in the distribution

- A distribution can have one or more modes

.codePanel[

```r
set.seed(1234)
tibble(var = c(rnorm(7000, 0, 1.8), 
               c(rnorm(4000, -2), rnorm(4000, 1.5)), # bimodal
               rep(seq(-7, 7, length.out = 40), each = 500)), # unif
       group = rep(LETTERS[c(1:3)], c(7000, 8000, 20000))) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(var)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 41) +
  labs(x = "Variable", y = "Frequency") +
  facet_wrap(~group)
```

.center[.smol[_Fig 2_ Examples of a (A) unimodal, (B) bimodal, and (C) multimodal distribution]]

---

## Median

- To find the median, first sort data
- Then find the mid-point (average of two mid-points if the number of observations is even)



&lt;iframe class="app" src="./assets/salary_plotly.html" height="300px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
.center[.smol[_Fig 3_ Average national annual salary per country sorted from lowest to highest]]



```r
median(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 12855
```

---

## Mean

- What most people mean by *average*
  - population mean `\(\mu\)`
  - sample mean `\(\bar{x}\)`
    `$$\bar{x}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N x_i}{N}$$`
    
- If there are *N* observations of variable *x* in our sample,
  `$$\sum_{i=1}^N x_i = x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots +x_N$$`


```r
mean(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 28685.77
```

---

## Median

- Not influenced by extreme values in sample (50% of sample is larger and 50% smaller, no matter what)
- Does not have a proper algebraic formula
- Medians of different samples from the same population can be relatively **different** from each other

## Mean

- Has a formula which allows us to do all sorts of maths (and stats) with it
- Means of different samples from the same population are relatively **similar** to each other 
- Sensitive to extreme values
- Basis for some measures of spread

## Variable types and central tendency

**Mode**
  - Mainly for discrete variables
  - Doesn't make much sense for truly continuous variables

**Median**
  - For variables that can be measured on _at least the ordinal level_

**Mean**
  - For variables that can be measured on _at least the interval level_

---

name: spread

## Measures of spread

- Mode, median, and mean tell us about the central point of a variable

- They don't tell us how spread the data are around this point, *e.g.*, how much **variability** there is in the variable

.codePanel[

```r
df &lt;- tibble(x = c(rnorm(5000), rnorm(5000, 0, 3)),
             dist = rep(1:2, each = 5000))
df %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(data = filter(df, dist == 1),
                 fill = "#3d755b", bins = 40, alpha = .5) +
  geom_histogram(data = filter(df, dist == 2),
                 fill = '#464b61', bins = 40, alpha = .5) +
  labs(x = "Value", y = "Count")
```

.center[.smol[_Fig 3_ Histogram of two distributions with equal means but different spread. *N*=5,000 in each case.]]

---

## Measures of spread

- Measures of spread (dispersion) tell us about the variability in the data

- We will look at the following:

  - Range

  - Inter-quartile range

  - Deviation
  
  - Variance
  
  - Standard deviation

---

## Range and Inter-quartile range

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe class="app" src="https://and.netlify.app/viz/desc.html" height="520px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

## Range

- Distance between smallest and largest value in sample
- *Drawback:* Extremely sensitive to outliers


```r
max(salary$yearly) - min(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 185560
```

## IQR

- Inter-quartile range - distance between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quartile
- *Drawback:* Ignores half of the data


```r
IQR(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 41820
```

---

## Deviation

- Distance from every single value in the data from some convenient point

- Mean is a convenient point

- `\(x_i - \bar{x}\)`, where `\(x_i\)` is every single data point

- There are as many deviations as data points

- To get a single measure of spread, how about we add up the deviations?

-  *Problem:* More data points = more points to add up

-  *BIG problem:* They always add up to zero

---

## Deviation and variance

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;iframe class="app" src="https://and.netlify.app/viz/desc.html" height="520px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

## Variance

- We get around the *BIG problem* (deviations adding up to 0) by taking the square of the deviations
  - The sum of these is called the _**S**um of **S**quares_

- We can get around the *problem* by dividing the sum of squares by *N*
  - This is the **variance**

Population variance: `\(\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}\)`

Sample variance: `\(s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N - 1}\)`

- reason for the `\(N - 1\)` is quite technical (see [Bessel's correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessel%27s_correction))


```r
var(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 1095256212
```

---

## Standard deviation

- Variance is a good measure of dispersion and is widely used
- One minor inconvenience is that it's measured in *squared units*
    - if salary is measured in years, *s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;*&lt;sub&gt;salary&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in USD&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, whatever those are
- Taking the square root of variance gives us a measure of spread in the original units
- This is the standard deviation
    - &amp;sigma; for population
    - _s_ (or _SD_) for sample

`$$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N - 1}}$$` 


```r
sd(salary$yearly)
```

```
## [1] 33094.66
```

- If we measured salary in 1000s of USD, _s_&lt;sub&gt;salary1000&lt;/sub&gt; would be **proportional** to&amp;nbsp;_s_&lt;sub&gt;salary&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(33.09 as opposed to 33094.66)

## From sample to population

- We want to make claims about the world

- _We don't care about samples, we care about populations_

- However, we cannot measure the entire population so we have to make do with samples

- So we end up making claims about the world based on what we know from the sample

- We _cannot be sure_ that our sample accurately represents the population

- Because of that, there's always **uncertainty** associated with any empirical claims we make

## From sample to population



A full set of Scrabble tiles contains 100 tiles with a mean tile value of 1.87 points and a _SD_ of 1.83.

&lt;iframe class="app" src="./assets/scrabble_plotly.html" height="330px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
.center[.smol[_Fig 4_ Distribution of Scrabble tiles by point value.]]

You draw - **sample** - 7 tiles for your rack
  - Sometimes you pick only vowels, sometimes you get only the Zs, Qs, Ks, or Ws due to _statistical fluctuation_ in **sampling**
  - Most often, you pick a mix of low-score and high-score tiles

## Sampling distribution

Sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic (*e.g.*, the mean) based on **all possible samples of a given size taken from the same population**

- In the Scrabble example it's the distribution of all possible means of 7-tile draws.

- _Sampling distribution is_ **NOT** _the distribution of the sample!_

- The centre (mean) of the sampling distribution is equal to the population value of the calculated statistic
  - The mean of the sampling distribution of **the mean** _is equal to the population mean_
  - The mean of the sampling distribution of **variance** _is equal to population variance_
  
- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is called the&amp;nbsp;**standard&amp;nbsp;error&amp;nbsp;(_SE_)**
  - Very important concept!
  - Allows us to quantify the uncertainty about our estimates


---

## Standard error

- **_SE_ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution**

- Quantifies the uncertainty about how similar the sample statistic (*e.g.*, the sample mean, `\(\bar{x}\)`) is likely to be to the population parameter (*e.g.*, population mean, `\(\mu\)`)

`$$SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$$`

- Related to **sample size** and **variability** in population
  - If mean annual salary doesn't change much from country to country, _SE_ will be relatively small
  - If our sample is large, _SE_ will be relatively small and _vice versa_
  
- **The concepts of the sampling distribution and standard error will be of crucial importance later, when we are talking about testing hypotheses and statistical modelling**

---

## Recap

- We can describe distributions ("shapes of variables") using maths

- Central tendency refers to the **mid-point** of a variable
  - Mode
  - Median
  - Mean

- Spread refers to the **amount variability** in the variable
  - Range
  - IQR
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation

- Each measure has its properties and is useful in different situations

---

## Recap

- We don't care about samples, we care about populations

  - But we have to rely on on samples because we don't have access to populations
  
- Different samples have different properties (*e.g.*, means) even though they are sampled from the same population

- The sampling distribution is the distribution of **a given statistic from all possible samples of the same size drawn from the same population**

- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the **standard error**

  - _SE_ quantifies the uncertainty about how similar the sample statistic is to the population parameter

  - The larger the sample, the smaller the _SE_

  - More variable populations lead to larger *SE*s
