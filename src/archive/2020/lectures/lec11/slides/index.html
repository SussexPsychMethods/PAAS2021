# Lecture 11: Recap
## Look back in angR
### Dr Lincoln Colling &amp; Dr Milan Valášek
### 7 December 2020

---








## Today

- We'll take turns briefly going over the material covered in each lecture

- After each lecture section, there will be space for discussion/clarification

- Get your questions ready!

---

## Lecture 1: Intro &amp; Housekeeping

Sam is fine, thanks!

---

## Lecture 2: Philosophy of Science

Introduced you to Philosophy of Science and covered some of the basics

- Common-sense view of science (as based on facts)

- Inductive and deductive logic

- *Popper* and falsification

- Amending and abandoning theories in the face in falsification

- *Lakatos* and research programmes


---

## Lecture 3: Approaches to Research

Introduced you to different approaches to research including qualitative and quantitative methods and computer simulation 

- Qualitative methods

  - Verbal protocol analysis, Ethnographic methods, Discourse analysis, and Phenomenology

  - Issues in qualitative research: Credibility, Transferability, Dependability, and Confirmability

- Quantitative methods

  - Quantification, operationalisation, causation, confounds

- Comparing qualitative and quantitative methods

- Computer simulation

  - What insights can be gained from computer simulation

---

## Lecture 4: Quantitative design

- How theories are used to generate testable predictions about the world


### Research design

- Breakdown according 3 criteria:

  - Presence of a manipulation (experimental vs observational)
  
  - Within-subjects vs between-subjects design
  
  - By time frame (longitudinal vs cross-sectional)

---

## Lecture 4: Quantitative design

### Experiment

Characteristics

  - **Experimental manipulation** - Changing variable in a study while _controlling_ for all other variables in order to test hypotheses about the effect of the independent variable
  - **Conditions** - Grouping of _stimuli_, where each group represents a level of manipulation
  - **Randomisation** - Participants are assigned to conditions at random to control for external sources of variability we cannot control; Order of trials is also randomised if possible
  - **Tight controls** - Ensure that any potential effect is really the result of the manipulation and not some _confounding_ variables
  - **Blinding** - Keeping participants na&amp;iuml;ve to hypotheses and manipulation (_single-blind_) and potentially also keeping experimenter na&amp;iuml;ve to allocation to conditions (_double-blind_)
  
**Only design that can reliably establish causal relationships**

---

## Lecture 4: Quantitative design

### Quasi-experiment &amp; natural experiments

- Not really experiments

- Either lack randomisation or the manipulation is not under researcher's control

### Observational design

- AKA correlational design

- No experimental manipulation at its heart

- Logistically more feasible, scalable

- Some things cannot be manipulated experimentally

**These designs cannot really make claims about causality, just relationships between things**

---

## Lecture 4: Quantitative design

### Between-subjects design

- AKA independent-groups design

- One participant **only contributes one observation** of the outcome variable

### Within-subjects 

- AKA repeated-measures design

- One participant provides **multiple observations** of the outcome variable

### Mixed design

- Contains elements of both between- and within-subjects designs

---

## Lecture 4: Quantitative design

### Cross-sectional design

- Takes a "cross-section" of a sample of a population **at a single time point** to investigate a hypothesis

- Unable to reliably address questions where time may be a factor (developmental studies)

### Longitudinal design

- Involves _repeated measurement_ of the same characteristic of the same participants at **multiple different time points**

- Logistically very complex and costly

---

## Lecture 4: Measurement

### Levels of measurement

- Nominal/categorical
  - Just labels
  
- Ordinal
  - Categories that can be meaningfully ordered
  
- Interval
  - Not only can values be ordered from smallest to largest but the distances between each two adjacent values are the same
  - No true zero point
  
- Ratio
  - True zero point

---

## Lecture 4: Measurement

### Validity

- **External validity** - Generalisability and ecological validity

- **Construct validity** - Extent to which a tool can be justifiably trusted to actually measure the construct it is supposed to measure

### Reliability 

- Ability of a measure to produce results that are an **accurate reflection** of the measured thing and **stable** over points of measurement

---

## Lecture 4: Variables

- Characteristic whose value varies within a set of subjects of interest

- With respect to study design we distinguish:
  - **Predictor** variables - In experimental studies also called _independent_ variables
  - **Outcome** variables - In experimental studies also called _dependent_ variables
  
### Variable types

- **Continuous** - Can contain _any numerical value_ within a certain range

- **Discrete** - Can only contain a discrete set of values

- **Binary** - Can only contain one of two values

---

## Lecture 5: Open Science    

Introduced open science and the replication crisis 

- The concepts of replication and reproducibility 

- Publication bias and some of it's sources

- **Pre-registration** as a way to combat bias (publication bias, experimenter bias, and statistical bias)

- How pre-registration works, and an example of a **registered report**


---

## Lecture 6: Samples, Populations, and Distributions

.smaller[
Samples and populations 

- The relationship between samples and populations

- Factors that influence whether a sample *resembles* the population (population variation, sample size)

Distributions 

- The binomial distribution

- The normal distribution

  - processes that produce normal distributions and processes that don't

  - deviations from normal including skew and kurtosis

Distributions and samples 

- Normal distribution of sample means
]

---

## Lecture 7: Descriptive statistics

### Measures of _central tendency_

- Central tendency is the **mid-point** of a variable or the "average" value
  - **Mode**: the most frequent value
  - **Median**: the mid-point if we sort our values from smallest to largest
  - **Mean**: the centre of the distribution, such that the combined distances (deviations) of all the points add up to zero. 

### Measures of _spread_

- Spread is the **amount variability** in the variable
  - **Range**: the distance between smallest and largest value in the variable
  - **IQR**: the distance between the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quartile
  - **Variance**: the average _squared_ deviation in the variable
  - **Standard deviation**: the average deviation in the variable

- Each measure has its properties, benefits, and drawback and is useful in different situations

---

## Lecture 7: The sampling distribution

- We don't really care about samples, we care about populations
- We have to rely on on samples because we don't have access to populations
- Different samples can have different properties (*e.g.*, means, variances) **even though they are sampled from the same population**

- The sampling distribution is the distribution of **a given statistic from all possible samples of the same size drawn from the same population**

- The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is the **standard error**
  - It quantifies the variability of a statistic from sample to sample
  - Describes the uncertainty about the relationship between the sample statistic (*e.g.*, `\(\bar{x}\)`) and the population parameter (*e.g.*, `\(\mu\)`)
  - The larger the sample, the smaller the _SE_
  - More variable populations lead to larger *SE*s

---

### Lecture 8: Distributions, transformations

- We talked about how we can think about the distributions of variables in terms of the **normal** curve
- The **mean** and the **standard deviation** (_SD_) reflect the position and spread of this curve, respectively.
- In a normal distribution, about 68% of all the values are concentrated within &amp;pm;1 standard deviation to either side of the mean
- **Transformations** are mathematical function that take data and do something to them
  - **Linear transformations** can shift or stretch/squish variables but the don’t change the relative distances between individual values of a variable
  - **Non-linear transformations**, such as exponentiation, do change the proportions of the transformed variables
  - **Centring** shifts the centre (mean) of a variable to some arbitrary point; it's done using addition/subtraction
  - **Scaling** changes the scale of the variable (_e.g._, from m to in); it's done using multiplication/division
- _z_-transform consists in first mean-centring (setting mean to zero) a variable and then scaling it by its _SD_
  - Resulting **_z_-scores** are interpreted as the number of _SD_ a given point is from the mean of the variable
  - Useful for comparing across populations and variables because it puts variables on a _common scale_
  
---

## Lecture 9: Tables and Plots

- Keep them clear, legible, organised, well-formatted

- Provide title and caption and, if need, notes explaining additional details

- Always label your plot axes!

- **Frequency plots** (bar plots and histograms) are good for visualising distributions of variables but rarely worth putting in your paper/report

- Plots and tables should supplement body text, not repeat what's already there

- There's no need to show the same thing in a table AND in a plot at the same time!

## Lecture 10: Introduction to probability

.smaller[
- Different view of probability: Classical, frequency, and subjective 

- Probability as counting up how many outcomes (out of all possible outcomes) lead to a specific event

Calculations with probability

- Addition law 
  - Mutuality exclusive events: Prob of at least one occurring is just the sum of the individual probabilities  [P(A &amp;cup; B) = P(A) + P(B)]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
  - Not mutuality exclusive events: Prob of at least one occurring is the sum of the individual probabilities minus the prob of both occurring [P(A &amp;cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &amp;cap; B)]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- Multiplication law 
    - Two independent events: Prob of both occurring is the product of their probabilities [P(A &amp;cap; B) = P(A) &amp;times; P(A)]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

]

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Note: I didn't cover this notation, but I've just included it for people that might find it useful. You **don't** need to know it]

---

## Lecture 10: Introduction to probability

Conditional probabilities

- For dealing events that aren't independent

- Probability a particular event **depends** on whether another event **has** or **has not** occurs 

Working with conditional probabilities

- Basics of Bayes

- Reasoning with Bayes: Taking into prior probabilities

- Reasoning with Bayes: P(A|B)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is not necessarily equal to P(B|A)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

- Fallacies and pitfalls of conditional probabilities: Knowing when you want P(A|B) and when you want P(B|A)

.footnote[&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;I did use this notation so you **do** need to know it]





---

## Exam format 

- 150 minutes (2 hours + 30 minutes for dealing with technical issues) + any extra time for special arrangements

- 50 *multi-choice* questions 

- Online via Canvas

- Must be completed within a 24 hour period

- If you have technical difficulties then it is possible to make a second attempt, **but don't use your second attempt as a chance to get a higher mark**... you'll get the second mark **not the higher of the two**!

- Worth 50% of your final grade

- Only covers context from the **lectures**. Nothing on **R**/**RStudio**

- There will be a sample exam on Canvas in the next few days

---

### Exam format

.smaller[
**Section 1:** Basic concepts 

  - 20 questions that cover the basic core concepts from the lectures. 

**Section 2:** Interpreting research output 

  - 25 questions where you'll be asked to interpret the results of 3 studies (2 &amp;times; 10 questions, 1 &amp;times; 5 questions)

  - These questions might relate directly to the data

  - Or they might cover similar concepts to Section 1, but with the study providing the context for the question 

  - Might involve some basic calculations 

**Section 3:** Identifying design flaws 

  - 5 questions 

  - Provided with a *brief* study description and you'll need to identify the fundamental flaw in the study that invalidates the researchers interpretation
