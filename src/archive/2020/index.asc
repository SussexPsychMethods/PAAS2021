Welcome to Psychology as a Science. You can find all the course materials, such as lecture slides, lecture handouts, and practical worksheets listed on this page.

== Lecture material


=== Week 01
Lecture 1: Introduction

Handout for Lecture 1 of PAAS, School of Psychology @ UniSussex

link:lectures/paas_lec01[Lecture handouts]

=== Week 02
Lecture 2: Philosophy of Science

We try to answer the question: 'What is this thing called "science"?'

=== Week 03
Lecture 3: Approaches to Research

Here we cover some approaches to you take to answering research questions. We'll cover qualitative and quantitative methods and briefly discuss methods like computer simulation and formal methods

link:lectures/lec03/slides[Lecture slides]

=== Week 04
Quantitative research, measurement, and variables



link:lectures/lec04/handout[Lecture handouts]


Lecture 4: Quantitative research

In an almost 60 slide-long lecturepalooza, we take you on a road trip through quantitative research design, measurement, and variables. That's value for money, that!

=== Week 05




link:lectures/lec05/slides[Lecture slides]


Lecture 5: Open Science

In this lecture we'll talk about "open science", the replication crisis, preregistration, and the lab report.

=== Week 06
Lecture 6: Samples, Populations, and Distributions

In this lecture we'll learn about samples and populations and how samples and populations can be described with distributions.

link:lectures/lec06/handout[Lecture handouts]






link:lectures/lec06/slides[Lecture slides]

=== Week 07
Descriptive statistics and the sampling distribution



link:lectures/lec07/handout[Lecture handouts]


Lecture 7: Towards statistical models

In this lecture we will discuss basic descriptive statistcs, viewing them not just as ways of summarising variables but also as simple models of the world. Then, we will "go a little meta" by talking about how these statistics are themselves variables with their own distributions and descriptive stats.

link:lectures/lec07/slides[Lecture slides]

=== Week 08
Distributions, functions, transformations



link:lectures/lec08/handout[Lecture handouts]


Lecture 8: Distributions, functions, transformations

In this lecture we will start thinking about variables in terms of distributions. We will see how we can perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication on entire variables to perform linear transformations. We'll discuss one transformation in particular, the z-transformation, and see how it's used to standardise the values of a variable. Finally, we will talk about how we can use simple maths to compare groups on a measured variable of interest.

=== Week 09
Lecture 9: Tables and plots

In this lecture we will learn how to create neat tables and plots allowing us to convey a lot of information about data in a small space.

link:lectures/lec09/slides[Lecture slides]

=== Week 10
Lecture 10: Introduction to probability

In this lecture we'll cover the basics 
of probability and how to reason about probabilities.

link:lectures/lec10/slides[Lecture slides]

=== Week 11
Lecture 11: Recap

The final lecture of Psychology as a Science focuses on recapitulating the topics from the previous lectures with a main focus on Q&A
